# SimSense: A Real-Time Depth Sensor Simulator
This is a GPU-accelerated depth sensor simulator for python. The goal of this project is to provide a real-time, adjustable, and off-the-shelf module that can simulate different kinds of real-world depth sensors. For more information, please refer to README in `main` branch.

## Usage In SAPIEN
An example usage of the module within SAPIEN can be found in this [tutorial](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/docs/latest/tutorial/rendering/depth_sensor.html).
